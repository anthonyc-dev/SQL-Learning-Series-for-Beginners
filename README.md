Got it ✅
You want a **main `README.md`** that serves as an **entry point** for your SQL documentation repo.
It should have:

* **Intro / Overview of SQL** (short + beginner-friendly)
* **Purpose of Repo** (what people will learn)
* **Navigation / Get Started section** (links to other `.md` files in series, like `01_basics.md`, `02_queries.md`, etc.)

Here’s a clean version you can use:

# 📘 SQL Documentation for Beginners

Welcome to the **SQL Learning Series**! 🚀
This repository is designed to help **beginners understand SQL step by step** — from the basics of queries to advanced optimization and best practices.

* Ensure security and scalability 🔒

Whether you’re just starting out or aiming to polish your SQL skills, this guide provides a structured path to learn effectively.
